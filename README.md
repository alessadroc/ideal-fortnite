# Fortnite Loot Pool Maker

Welcome to the Fortnite Loot Pool Maker!

This is an open-source web application intended for Fortnite Battle Royale players.

It's to visualise their ideal choices for what guns should and should not be available in Battle Royale.

All images of weapons are to be stored in assets, and all styling is to be kept index.css.

Happy coding!
